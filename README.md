Youi Insurance Application : Coding Exercise

Would you mind completing the exercise described below.  Hopefully the task itself will be very simple to implement, but we’d like to see you demonstrate how you would decompose the problem as well as unit test the components you write.  
  
Feel free to use the libraries that you’re most comfortable with, but could you write the code itself in C#. 
 ·         Can you provide us with a program that reads a CSV file and outputs two text files.  
 ·         The first should show the frequency of the first and last names ordered by frequency and then alphabetically.  
 ·         The second should show the addresses sorted alphabetically by street name.  
  
As mentioned can you also include a unit test project using which ever unit testing framework you’re most comfortable with.
